# simple-image-slide-compare

A simple offline version of the slide picture comparator



# Feature

* No need to upload images, just select a local image to use. ** Note ** The best comparison picture is the same height to width ratio. If the resolution of the left figure is 512*1024, the comparison figure can be 768*1536, 1024*2048 and so on

* Support the roller to zoom in and out for a specific area.

* Support Modify image title


# Example



0. Right-click the browser and open 'image-slide-compare.html'

1. Upload a picture of 1024*1536 on the left

![image](./img/before.png)

2. On the right, upload a picture of 4096*6144 magnified by upscaly HD

![image](./img/highres.png)

3. After uploading

4. Move the mouse arrow to the mouth area, then scroll to zoom in

It can be obviously seen that there is no change in details after the upscaly is tall, and the effect is normal after 4x magnification.
